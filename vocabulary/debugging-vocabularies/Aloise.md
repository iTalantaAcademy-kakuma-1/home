**# RUN TIME ERRORS WITH EXAMPLE**

A program crash is the most noticeable type of runtime error since the program unexpectedly quits while running. Crashes can be caused by memory leaks or other programming errors.

Runtime errors are commonly called referred to as "bugs," and are often found during the **debugging** process, before the software is released. When runtime errors are found after a program has been distributed to the public, developers often release patches, or small updates, designed to fix the errors.

 
 A **runtime error** is a **program** error that occurs while the program is running. The term is often used in contrast to other types of program errors, such as **syntax errors** and **compile** time errors.

### Example:
- let foods = [
    { name: "chicken", price: 450 },
  { name: "pilau", price: 400 },
  { name: "chips", price: 200 },
  
];

let reduceFoods = foods.reduce((check) => { return prev, next.reduce>200})
console.log(reduceFoods)

- let math = 78;
let eng = 70;
let total = math + eng;
console.log("I got math " + maths + " i got eng " + eng);
console.log(`I got math ${math} i got eng ${eng}`);
console.log("my total is ", total);
console.log(`my total is ${math + eng}`);

const pie = 3.142;
let height1 = 20;
let height2 = 15;
let radius = 10;
console.log(
  `${pie * Math.pow(radius, 2) * height1 - pie * Math.pow(radius, 2) * height2}`
);

*These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.*
