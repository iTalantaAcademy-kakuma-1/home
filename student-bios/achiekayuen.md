I'm **ACHIEK AYUEN**, a young aspiring software developer based in Kakuma
Refugee camp. I'm current under intensive training that is facilitated by
**WINDLE INTERNATIONAL KENYA**.

My dream is to become one of the competent and skilled I.T expert who can
develop products that could long-term positive impact in the society. As a young
developer, it is my ambition to create I.T related jobs so that the unemployed
youths can become self-reliant.
